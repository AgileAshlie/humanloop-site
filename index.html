       THE PROBLEM
  ========================== -->
  <section id="problem">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Problem People Feel</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Care and Communication are fragmented across specialists</li>
        <li>Symptoms and Support are managed in isolation</li>
        <li>Stress and Burnout are normalized</li>
        <li>People are left to connect the dots themselves</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="callout">
        When systems are overloaded — human or organizational — performance rarely fails all at once; it erodes.

       THE GAP
  ========================== -->
  <section id="gap">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Gap</h2>
      <p>
        No one helps translate medical advice into daily life.
        No one supports behavior change in real time.
        No one holds the whole human system together.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where capable people stall — not from lack of effort,
        but from lack of coordinated support.

       THE ALTERNATIVE
